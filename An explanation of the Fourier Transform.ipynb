    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will be begin with framing the ideas behind the FT and then go into the more complex details for the DFT, but I will not cover the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) as it is just the DFT's algorithmic implementation. The first question I would like to ask is: what is your interpretation of a frequency $f$ or $\\omega$?. Hopefully, the following may come to mind: \n",
    "- It describes some rate, such as the rate of oscillation in sinusoids.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is a term used in MEV that has units of $Hz$ or $\\frac{rad}{s}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is the angular velocity around the centre of mass in bodies that undergo some rotation.\n",
    "\n",
    "All three of these ideas are partially correct and depend on application context, but what is important is that all three of these ideas are key to interpreting the FT. So, without further ado, let's jump right into understanding the FT and the DFT. \n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea of the FT is to determine the important frequency components $f$ in a signal, and we can understand this idea by investigating the Fourier series. The Fourier series introduces this idea that a real valued periodic function $g(x)$ can be decomposed into a series of sinusoidal components. This is formally written as \n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "g_N(x) = \\frac{a_0}{2} + \\sum_{n=1}^N \\left[ a_n \\cos(\\frac{2\\pi}{P} n x) + b_n \\sin(\\frac{2\\pi}{P} n x) \\right],\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $N$ is the number of components used to decompose $g(x)$, $P$ is the interval length of $g(x)$ and $a_n$ and $b_n$ are the amplitude weighting components applied to the cosine and sine functions. For those interested, $a_0$, $a_n$ and $b_n$ are found through\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "a_n = \\frac{2}{P} \\int_P g(x) \\cdot \\cos(\\frac{2\\pi}{P} n x) dx,\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "b_n = \\frac{2}{P} \\int_P g(x) \\cdot \\sin(\\frac{2\\pi}{P} n x) dx,\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "a_0 = \\frac{2}{P} \\int_P g(x) dx.\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "However, what if we wish to determine which sinusoidal components are dominant in the signal without knowing its analytical function? To do this, we move away from the Fourier series and introduce the idea behind the Fourier Transform. It is of crucial importance to note that these two methods are *not the same*, but they have strong connections to one another. To show the relation between the two, consider the following Fourier Series formulation of $g(x) = x - \\lfloor x \\rfloor$ (using the first question from the first assignment, the derivation is on the [github repository](https://github.com/RyanBalshaw/MEV781_Tutorials))\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "g_N(x) = \\frac{1}{2} - \\sum_{n=1}^N \\frac{1}{\\pi n} \\sin(2 \\pi n x).\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "This expansion is visualised below, and the relation between the Fourier Series and the Fourier Transform is that the amplitude of the sinusoidal components at a given integer harmonic provides some indication of how the Fourier Transform will look (this is not completely correct, but it is a sufficient proxy at this stage so do not read too much into it)."

    "To describe the Fourier Transform, I will quote Wikipedia (i.e., basic ChatGPT): \"In mathematics, a Fourier transform is a mathematical transform that decomposes functions depending on space or time into functions depending on spatial or temporal frequency, such as the expression of a musical chord in terms of the volumes and frequencies of its constituent notes. The term Fourier transform refers to both the frequency domain representation and the mathematical operation that associates the frequency domain representation to a function of space or time.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This may seem intimidating for those less well versed with the Fourier Transform, so let's decompose this into sub-ideas: \n",
    "1. The Fourier Transform shifts/transforms functions in the time domain to the frequency domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A mathematical operation is required to facilitate this transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Great, but how does this help us? I will try to explain the intuition behind the mathematical operations in a simple way, with the help of some useful visual plots that one can interact with. This may seem somewhat abstract, but if you bear with me, it will hopefully all make sense at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Idea 1**\n",
    "\n",
    "Before I detail the Fourier Transform, let's try the following: let's take a signal $g(t)$ (where the change of independent variable is necessary for time-series data) and wrap it around a 2D axis. To enable this process, let's first consider the meaning of frequency components $f$ and $\\omega$: the units for $f$ is typically $Hz$ or $cycles/s$ and the variable $\\omega$ has units of $rad/s$. One can obtain $\\omega$ from $f$ through $\\omega = 2 \\pi f$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why is this useful? Well in a physics context, $\\omega$ describes the rate at which something rotates around an axis. So, to wrap a signal around a 2D axis, we take the signal $g(t)$, its time $t$, a pre-selected $f_0$ value and now exploit some simple physics relationships, namely:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\theta(t) = \\int_{0}^{t}\\omega(\\tau)d\\tau,\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where the indefinite integral $\\int\\omega(t)dt$ can be written in this form if $\\theta(t = 0) = 0$ and we are only concerned with $t \\geq 0$, which is a reasonable assumption to make in this case. If we assume that $\\omega(t)$ is a constant ($\\omega(t) = \\omega_0$) then the angular displacement becomes\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\theta(t) = \\omega_0 t.\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "This expression allows us to work out where $g(t = t_i)$ will lie in a 2D plane by working out the angular position in the 2D plane and by letting $g(t = t_i)$ be the distance from the origin at some angular position $\\theta(t=t_i)$. More realistically, we can just work out the rotation  $\\theta_i$ for all time indices $t_i$ and then plot the data using $x(t_i) = g(t_i) \\cos(\\theta_i)$ and $y(t_i) = g(t_i) \\sin(\\theta_i)$, where we obtain the rotation $\\theta$ through $\\theta_i = 2 \\pi f_0 t_i$ (note here that I dropped the time index notation $\\cdot(t)$ and replaced it with an index notation $\\cdot_i$ as I need to discretise the system to plot it). This effectively shifts the signal from a 2-dimensional Euclidean coordinate system into the polar coordinate system. Let's now go through this process cell by cell."

    "1. For those of you who come from a control systems background, you may ask how does the FT relate to the Laplace Transform? The FT can be considered a special case of the Laplace transform with $\\alpha = 0$. To prove this, consider the Laplace transform equation:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\mathcal{X}(s) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x(t) e^{st}dt,\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $s = \\alpha + i \\omega$. Simply zeroing $\\alpha$ leaves us with the original Fourier transform. A more in-depth and intuitive discussion around the relationship between these two transforms can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2y7n6jw5d0).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is the offset we see when $f=0$? This is simply the DC offset of the signal, otherwise referred to as the signal mean. To prove this, consider the following:\n",

    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "\\mathcal{X}(0) &= \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x(t) e^{-i 2 \\pi 0 t}dt \\\\\n",
    "&= \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x(t) e^{0}dt \\\\\n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Does the $-\\infty$ and $\\infty$ bounds on the integral change affect the process we have gone through?  Well, when we implement the FT, in practice, we often do not know the true signal function $x(t)$ and we can only discretely sample the signal in some interval. To address the integral bounds, we assume that the sampled signal is continuously recirculated and thus represents a signal $x(t)$ with period T. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. You just mentioned that we commonly just sample a signal, so what happens in the FT? As we discretely sample the signal, we do not implement the FT but rather the DFT. If you follow the MEV781 B1-03 lecture slides, you can clearly see that the DFT just expands the continuous case to discrete signals with a sampling rate $F_s = \\frac{1}{\\Delta t}$. The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is just an efficient algorithm used to solve for the DFT coefficients."

Each index of the DFT then spaced using $freq_{@X[k]} = k\\times \\frac{F_s}{N}$, $k = 0, 1, \\cdots, N - 1$, where $\\frac{F_s}{N}$ is known as the frequency resolution ($\\Delta f$).

    "Now, when some of you follow this approach and visualise the DFT, is it expected that the plot have some visual symmetry, as if the DFT is mirrored about some frequency component. The reason for this is simple to visualise, but is an important aspect of the DFT. The basic reason can be elaborated through the rotation direction, where changes in rotation direction in a complex domain cannot be detected in the real domain. To make this clearer, consider the cell below (please run it, observe what happens and then come back here). Notice that the line in the real-time plane is equivalent and the rotation direction cannot be identified. However, in the complex-time plane, the lines are out of sync.

This frequency component is commonly referred to as the Nyquist frequency. After this point, all of the DFT indices are simply the complex conjugates of previously determined indices.
