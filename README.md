# MEV781_Tutorials

This is a repository for any MEV781 tutorials I write up in my spare time.

This page will simply consist of Jupyter notebook files that one can access and use. Please download the files and run them on your system.

The tutorials thus far are as follows:
1. The Fourier Transform (updated 31 August 2021)
2. A basic explanation of Time Synchronous Averaging and Computed Order Tracking (Updated 3 June 2022, thank you to Ulrich for spotting an issue in my example code! Further updated 14/04/2023, I noticed a massive notation issue in one part of the write-up that has now been fixed.)

Tutorials I wish to add:
- A tutorial on the wavelet transform could be interesting.
- Perhaps another interesting tutorial on the Kurtogram and other Grams (might be useful to explain filter banks and how certain measures of non-Gaussianity work).
- A tutorial on cyclostationarity would be awesome, but it would not be simple and I would not be able to do it alone.

## 2023 Update
This tutorial has been pushed to [Sjmelck](https://ryanbalshaw.github.io/sjmelck_pages/). I will leave all of the notebooks up for consistency, but I recommend looking at the blog for future content.
