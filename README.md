# MEV781_Tutorials

This is a repository for any MEV781 tutorials I write up in my spare time.

This page will simply consist of Jupyter notebook files that one can access and use. Please download the files and run them on your system.

The tutorials thus far are as follows:
1. The Fourier Transform (updated 31 August 2021)
2. A basic explanation of Time Synchronous Averaging and Computed Order Tracking (Updated 3 June 2022, thank you to Ulrich for spotting an issue in my example code!)

Tutorials I wish to add:
- A tutorial on the wavelet transform could be interesting.
- Perhaps another interesting tutorial on the Kurtogram and other Grams (will need to discuss with others).
- A tutorial on cyclostationarity would be awesome, but it would not be simple and I would not be able to do it alone.
